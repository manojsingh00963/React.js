## Features

- Fast Refresh with React using Vite
- Modern build tools for a smooth development experience

## Official Plugins

Currently, two official plugins are available for React with Vite:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) - Utilizes [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) - Uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.

## Installation

To set up the Weather Finder app, run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install axios react-loader-spinner @fortawesome/react-fontawesome @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons
